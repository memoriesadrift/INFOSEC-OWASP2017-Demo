Simply run these filles on a php server.
For fix2 and fix3 you may need to give write permission to the fix2 and fix3 folders to the php application.

For an explanation on what is happening in these examples and where the insecure deserialization happens, please reffer to our paper.

Feel free to submit an issue or contact me if anything does not work on your end.
